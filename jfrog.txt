Setup JFrog Artifactory on Ubuntu 18.0.4 using Docker | Install JFrog Artifactory on Ubuntu 
Artifactory is one of the popular Binary repository manager. It is Java based tool, used for storing artifacts. Artifactory can be integrated with many Continuous integration and Continuous delivery tools. Artifactory is mainly used by Ant, Maven and Gradle build tools.

Let us see how to configure Artifactory on Ubuntu 18.0.4 using Docker. We will configure Artifactory by doing the three steps:

1. Install Docker on Ubuntu 18.0.4
2. Download Artifactory image
3. Spin up a container using the Artifactory image 
Pre-requistes:
Choose at least small or medium instance type (2GB RAM)
ports 8081 and 8082 needs to be opened.
8081 for Artifactory REST APIs.
8082 for everything else (UI, and all other product’s APIs). 
1. Install Docker on Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install docker.io -y

If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider adding your user to the “docker” group with something like:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
 
Run the command below to see a version of docker installed.  
docker --version
Step 2: Download Artifactory Docker image
There are different editions of JFrog Artifactory available, let us use open source version.

Pull the latest Docker image of JFrog Artifactory.
sudo docker pull docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss:latest

Display docker images
sudo docker images

Step 3: Create Data Directory
Create data directory on host system to ensure data used on container is persistent.
sudo mkdir -p /jfrog/artifactory
sudo chown -R 1030 /jfrog/
Step 4: Start JFrog Artifactory container
To start an Artifactory container, use the command:
sudo docker run --name artifactory -d -p 8081:8081 -p 8082:8082 \
-v /jfrog/artifactory:/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory \
docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss:latest


Step 5: Run Artifactory as a service
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/artifactory.service
 # Copy the below code highlighted in green 

[Unit]
Description=Setup Systemd script for Artifactory Container
After=network.target

[Service]
Restart=always
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker kill artifactory
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm artifactory
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --name artifactory -p 8081:8081 -p 8082:8082 \
  -v /jfrog/artifactory:/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory \
  docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss:latest
ExecStop=-/usr/bin/docker kill artifactory
ExecStop=-/usr/bin/docker rm artifactory

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target 

Reload Systemd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Then start Artifactory container with systemd.
sudo systemctl start artifactory
Enable it to start at system boot.
sudo systemctl enable artifactory
Check whether Artifactory is running?  
sudo systemctl status artifactory
Step 6: Access Artifactory Web Interface
